# game-server-socketio
Starter Node.js server code demonstrating socket.io proof of concept, meant as a blueprint for other projects. Meant to be used with the game-client-socketio codebase.

To install requirements:

```
npm install
```

To run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will then listen on http://localhost:3080/ and requires the nukellogg/game-client-socketio client to communicate with it.
